 - Added the login pipeline.
    - Had to do major work including changing the way a token is transmitted from being a cookie to being an actual server object that comes back on the response.
 - Merged the 'SetCookie' method of memberControllerBase and GuestController to be one method of UserController base. 
 - Added debugging and appropriate launch.json config for that.

 - Added a simple CLI and logger to the server. There is now a separate thread for the CLI and the server runs in the background. The server can be stopped through the CLI. The CLI can also toggle logging and get a count of the active users.
